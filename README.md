# Installation & Development
#### First ```npm install``` !!!
- ```npm dev``` for dev preview with hot reload
- ```npm build``` for building static files, hydrated by API, which can be deployed browser, edge, everywhere... (Jamstack)

# Hosting
#### Runs on browser, edge, everywhere... My personal favorite is Cloudflare... https://pages.cloudflare.com/

# GUN relay
#### You need to run a Gun relay in order to sync clients!
- Gun Desktop Relay https://github.com/worldpeaceenginelabs/ELECTRON-GUN (ready to run with Cesium-Gun)

Run localhost (now localhost:8765) or with noip.com for DYNDNS (more in Electron-Gun readme)
